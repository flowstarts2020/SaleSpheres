## Objective
The objective of this repository is to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application that is deployed on a serverless platform. Next, using a third-party monitoring tool SenseDeep on monitoring the function and health on this serverless
application.

## Step 1: Create a code repository in GitHub
## Step 2: Clone the code repository into local machine
## Step 3: Create index.js file
## Step 4: Create serverless.yml
## Step 5: Deploy and verify that the serverless application is working
## Step 6: Test and execute the following commands
$ npm install
```
and then deploy with:
```
$ serverless deploy
## Step 7: Create CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
Create main.yml in .github/workflows folder. 
## Step 8: Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and ASW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to GitHub Secrets
## Step 9: Push changes to GitHub to start the workflow
Commit changes locally and push it to GitHub. Navigate the repo on GitHub, click on the **Actions** tab to see the workflows.
## Step 10: Access AWS Console to check the Lambda application

## Step 11: Test many times to Invoke the Lambda application
## Step 12: Check any readings when monitoring the Lambda application
## Step 13: Access and login SenseDeep application
## Step 14: Create the widgets of graph views on SUM and Average for the related relevant monitoring Lambda application
## Step 15: Completion on ready to view centralize Dashboard
